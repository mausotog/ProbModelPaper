% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of the IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off
% such as if a citation ever needs to be enclosed in parenthesis.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use

% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.

% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics.
%
% Note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/amsmath





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as the IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithms
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/algorithmicx




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/array


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.




% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\ifCLASSOPTIONcompsoc
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=normalsize,labelfont=sf,textfont=sf]{subfig}
%\else
%  \usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%\fi
% subfig.sty, written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern replacement
% for subfigure.sty, the latter of which is no longer maintained and is
% incompatible with some LaTeX packages including fixltx2e. However,
% subfig.sty requires and automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty
% which will override IEEEtran.cls' handling of captions and this will result
% in non-IEEE style figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure
% and invoke subfig.sty's "caption=false" package option (available since
% subfig.sty version 1.3, 2005/06/28) as this is will preserve IEEEtran.cls
% handling of captions.
% Note that the Computer Society format requires a larger sans serif font
% than the serif footnote size font used in traditional IEEE formatting
% and thus the need to invoke different subfig.sty package options depending
% on whether compsoc mode has been enabled.
%
% The latest version and documentation of subfig.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/subfig




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure.
% Be aware that LaTeX2e kernels dated 2015 and later have fixltx2e.sty's
% corrections already built into the system in which case a warning will
% be issued if an attempt is made to load fixltx2e.sty as it is no longer
% needed.
% The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/fixltx2e


%\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/stfloats
% Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as the IEEE does not allow
% \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the IEEE should note
% that the IEEE rarely uses double column equations and that authors should try
% to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the cuted.sty or midfloat.sty
% packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as the IEEE does not format its papers in
% such ways.
% Do not attempt to use stfloats with fixltx2e as they are incompatible.
% Instead, use Morten Hogholm'a dblfloatfix which combines the features
% of both fixltx2e and stfloats:
%
% \usepackage{dblfloatfix}
% The latest version can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/dblfloatfix


\usepackage{verbatim}
\usepackage{amsmath}
\usepackage{amsfonts}
\usepackage{amssymb}
\usepackage{graphicx}

% INCLUDE THIS
\usepackage{listings, lstautogobble}

% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/pkg/url
% Basically, \url{my_url_here}.




% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.

\begin{abstract}
Automatic Software Repair (APR) has significant potential to reduce software
maintenance costs by reducing the human effort required to localize and fix
bugs. Well-known state-of-the-art generate-and-validate 
APR approaches select between and instantiate various mutation operators
to construct candidate patches, informed by largely heuristic probability
distributions.  This may reduce effectiveness in terms of both efficiency and
output quality: patches informed by the ways humans fix bugs may be considered
more acceptable.  In practice, human developers
have many options in terms of how to edit code to fix bugs, some of which 
are far more common than others (e.g., deleting a line of code is more common
than adding a new class).
Treating such edits as 
APR mutation operators, we  
mined the most recent 100 bug-fixing commits from each of the 500 most popular Java projects in Github (largest 
dataset to date) to
create a probabilistic model describing edit distributions.
We categorize, compare and evaluate the different mutation operators used in 
the state of the art approaches. Finally, we mine association rules to analyze context surrounding
multi-edit source code changes, an understudied problem 
that covers the majority of real source code changes. Our evaluation
indicates that by applying the probabilistic model we are able to find
the correct mutation operator to patch bugs faster in the majority of bugs
studied, and that using the superset of all mutation operators performs better than restricting the mutation operator pool to just one category.

\section{Introduction} \label{introduction}

\todo{note to CLG/self: say something about how fix localization is totally
  understudied, and mention it again in the conclusion about our contribution.}

% no \IEEEPARstart
Repairing errors is one of the most 
resource intensive tasks in 
the software development process~\cite{Weiss07,Tassey02,Britton13}, especially for large, real-world systems~\cite{Liblit03,Anvik05}.
%
Significant recent research effort has been dedicated to
building automatic program repair (APR) tools that are able to address
bugs in 
programs (e.g.~\cite{legoues12,kim2013,Weimer13,long15SPR,long16proph,debroy10,perkins09,wei10}).

One well-known class of repair techniques follows a 
\emph{generate-and-validate} approach  (e.g. GenProg~\cite{legoues12}, 
Par~\cite{kim2013}, TrpAutoRepair~\cite{Qi13TrpAutoR}
Prophet~\cite{long16proph}, HDRepair~\cite{xuan16}, Angelix~\cite{Mechtaev2016},
Nopol~\cite{xuanNopol}).  This approach takes as input a test suite, 
including at
least one failing test case exposing
a defect, and source code to be 
modified.  These approaches then \emph{generate} candidate patches
by applying 
mutation operators to the original source code and \emph{validate} each by
running the potentially patched program against the test suite.  The goal is to
construct or identify a patch that
leads the program to pass all input test cases. 

The search space of possible patches that can repair any bug is trivially
infinite, introducing key tensions in APR
technique design.  First, 
techniques must manage the space carefully so as to traverse it in a scalable and
effective manner.  One way that current techniques manage this problem is to
only consider a limited set of of possible changes, or \emph{mutation operators}, 
applied to potentially-fault code (typically identified using off-the-shelf fault 
localization, e.g. Tarantula~\cite{Jones02}).  
Techniques differ in the mutation operators they consider, and how those operators
are instantiated.  Syntactically-informed APR techniques typically instantiate
mutations by selecting repair code heuristically from elsewhere in the same
file, module, or program.  As a simple example, GenProg~\cite{legoues12Genprog} can either
delete program statements, replace one statement for another, or insert one
statement after another; the ``fix'' statements are selected from elsewhere in
the same program.  There is a broad diversity of such syntactic operators used
by other APR techniques, including more complicated templated modifications~\cite{kim2013} and transformation 
schemas~\cite{long16proph,long15SPR}.  Semantically-informed
techniques~\cite{nguyen13,Mechtaev2016,xuanNopol} differ in that they use synthesis to
construct the fix code used in instantiating program modifications.  
Regardless, any such technique uses heuristics or heuristically-informed
probability distributions to select between either mutation operators or fix
code (or both) when constructing candidate patches. 

However, even with these design choices, the search space of candidate
repairs for many bugs remains intractably large.  Most techniques are thus
limited by design to producing single-edit patches (e.g. TrpAutoRepair~\cite{Qi13TrpAutoR}). 
Those few that can theoretically produce multi-edit patches
typically still only produce small changes in
practice~\cite{Qi15,arcuri11,Mechtaev2016}. 
Indeed, patches
consisting of several mutations are undertreated in the APR context, even though the vast majority
of real bug-fixing patches are comprised of multiple edits~\cite{Soto16,zhong15}.

These attempts to tackle scalability are in tension with a second major concern
in APR research: the quality of the generated patches~\cite{Qi15}.  One way to
improve output quality is to use more expressive mutation operators, producing a
richer search space~\cite{long16}.  However, more and more expressive mutation
operators increase the size of the 
space, and not always in a way that supports the construction of more correct
patches.  Thus, although APR techniques would benefit from more expressive
operators, they cannot do so without a way to choose between them that manages
the search space explosion problem, ideally while increasing the probability
of finding truly correct patches.

In bug-fixing reality, human developers use
certain mutation operators much more often than others (e.g. adding an \emph{IfStatement} is more common than adding a \emph{TypeDeclarationStatement})~\cite{Soto16}. In this
work, we propose to study
and then systematically simulate the behavior of human developers to create
patches. This idea has been leveraged manually, to create
mutation operators that produce more human-acceptable patches~\cite{kim2013} and
automatically, to inform patch \emph{ranking} (rather than
construction) when traversing the search space~\cite{xuan16,long16proph}. 
Our key supposition is that our approach can scalably support a richer
search space constructed via more expressive mutation operators that are more
likely to produce high-quality patches.  

To this end, we mine bug fixing commits from 
the 500 most popular Github Java projects to model the selection probability of
the possible mutation operators based on 
empirical data that describes how human programmers fix their code.  
The APR search space, including the various mutation
operators used by different techniques, has been growing in a relatively ad hoc 
manner through the various approaches proposed in recent years. We thus
categorize, compare, and validate a superset of
mutation operators in use in a number of 
state-of-the-art approaches~\cite{legoues12,Weimer13,kim2013,long16proph}.
We use this model to inform a repair approach that chooses from the set of possible
operators based on these real-world probabilities.
As a result, our work goes beyond prior work  by generalizing
to a broader and more expressive set of
mutation operators, and using a fully-automatically-mined model much 
earlier in the APR process, when patch candidates are actually \emph{created.}
Furthermore, we propose and initially validate a new approach for modeling
multi-edit repairs based on mining previous rules from historical edit data, 
predicting from a given 
single-edit mutation which operation should be applied
next.  This serves  as a first step towards
scalable traversal of the multi-edit patch space. 

We evaluate the predictive power of our mined models on their own, in terms of their
accuracy in predicting the operators used in real-world bug fixes.  We also
integrate the single-edit model into a new repair algorithm that we demonstrate
in comparison to several previous techniques on a subset of real-world defects from Defects4j~\cite{just14}. 
%
The primary contributions of this paper thus are:
\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Empirical model of single-edit repairs to Java code} mined
      from the 100 most recent bug fixes from the 500 most popular Java projects on
    Github. This study also provides a deeper
    understanding of which mutation operators are used by programmers to fix
    errors in source code, and the frequency of each of the mutation operators
    analyzed. 
	\item \textbf{New Repair Approach}, which uses mutation operators
    from multiple state-of-the-art approaches and
    the above-mentioned models to choose between them, favoring those more commonly
    used by human developers.  We validate the use of this model, as well as a
    good set of operators to use for expressive, high-quality repair.
    \item \textbf{Development and integration} of this approach for the Java
      programming language in a tool, available online, which can apply the
      several different mutation operators, and the probabilistic model
      discussed in this study.\footnote{We will release all artifacts, code, and
        data, including generated test suites, associated with this publication post blind-review.} %\footnote{https://bitbucket.org/clegoues/genprog4java}
  \item \textbf{Comparative evaluation} of the new repair approach on real world bugs from well
    known open source projects (independent of those used to inform model
    construction). We independently evaluate patch quality using a held-out test
    suite. We conclude that by creating candidate patches using human behavior
    we are able to find patches faster than a technique that does not use such
    mined probabilities, and that the patch creation
    process benefits from combining mutation operator categories. We compare to
    other state-of-the-art tools on the same bugs, assessing expressiveness and
    output quality. 
  \item \textbf{Multi-edit repair approach} A proposed technique, and an initial
    validation thereof, to construct 
    bug-fixing patches requiring several mutations by mining and then applying association
    rules from a large set of historical bug fixes. 
\end{itemize}

The rest of this paper proceeds as follows: We first outline
generate-and-validate repair and, in particular, 
categorize and generalize the mutation operators used in state of the art
approaches (Section~\ref{background}). Section~\ref{buildingTheModel}
describes our approach to building probabilistic models of human 
edits for both single- and multi-edit bug fixes. Section~\ref{evaluation}
describes our evaluation. Section~\ref{relatedWork} describes
related work; Section~\ref{conclusion} talks about the conclusions found in this study. 

\section{Generate-and-validate repair and operators} 
\label{background}

In this section, we outline generate and validate repair at a high level
(Section~\ref{sec-paradigm}), to provide the necessary background to understand our
work.\footnote{We focus on relevant background in this section, and describe
  other techniques for automatic program repair in Section~\ref{relatedWork}.}
  We then detail and categorize the mutation operators used in prior approaches
  for syntactic program repair and that we model, mine, and leverage in our approach
(Section~\ref{categorization}).  
 
 
\subsection{Paradigm}
\label{sec-paradigm}


Figure~\ref{fig:generateandvalidate} outlines the general paradigm for generate-and-validate repair. This approach starts with source code with one or more bugs, and a test suite. The test suite contains passing
test cases to witness the correct program behavior, and one or more failing test 
cases to expose the behavior to be repaired.

\begin{figure}[!h]
  \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Picture1}
  \caption{Generate-and-validate repair approach.}
  \label{fig:generateandvalidate}
\end{figure}

A generic generate-and-validate APR approach first
localizes the error to a smaller set of
candidate program statements (typically using an off-the-shelf statistical approach~\cite{Jones02}).  It
then constructs one or more candidate patches that seek to fix the buggy
behavior without breaking any previously-correct behavior.  
Techniques vary in (1) the mutation operators they consider, (2) how they select
between those operators, and how they identify or
construct the fix code used to instantiate them, and (3) how they traverse
the search space otherwise.  
Most mutation operators (with the exception of deletion) require new code to
fill in ``holes.''  For example, an operator that replaces one statement with
another must select replacement code; an operator that wraps a statement
in a null check must select the object to be checked against null.
Syntactic approaches (e.g.,~\cite{legoues12Genprog,long16proph,kim2013,xuan16}) typically select this code from within the
same function, module, file, or program.  Semantic approaches instead use synthesis to
construct fix code.  
In both cases, heuristics inform code selection.  For example, some syntactic approaches
choose between fix code uniformly at random or using other set probability distributions~\cite{examples}; others used learned
models to do so~\cite{long16proph}.  Semantic approaches use heuristics to
decide which program components should be made available to the synthesis
engine~\cite{Mechtaev2016,xuanNopol}. 

Once constructed of one or more such mutations, each candidate patch is
applied to the input program, which is then run on
one or more of the input test cases for evaluation.  If a patch leads the
program to 
pass all the test cases in the test suite, including those originally witnessing
the bug, it is presented as a likely repair for the bug. 
If not, the APR algorithm typically creates more candidate patches 
until it reaches a pre-defined resource limit. 
Here, too, search strategies vary: some techniques 
are explicitly single-edit~\cite{Qi13TrpAutoR,Weimer13,nopol}; others use
random search strategies, like a random walk~\cite{debroy10} or genetic
programming~\cite{kim2013,legoues12,xuan16}; etc. 

Patch quality is an important concern in APR research~\cite{Qi15}: Ideally,
created patches will generalize beyond the test cases used to inform their
construction~\cite{smith15}, and conform to other non-functional standards of
acceptability~\cite{fry2010,kim2013}.  Although assessing patch quality is an
unsolved reasearch problem~\cite{monperrus14critical}, one mechanism to evaluate functional patch
correctness is to evaluate generated patches on a held-out test suite~\cite{smith15,legoues12Genprog}, separate
from the tests used to construct the patches. 
If the generated patch allows the program to pass all held-out tests, it is more likely to
\emph{generalize} to the desired but unwritten specification. If the patched
program fails held-out tests, the patch is said to \emph{overfit} to 
the test suite used to guide the repair. 


\subsection{Generate-and-validate mutation operators} 
\label{categorization}

We categorize mutation operators used to create patches from a cross
section of state-of-the-art techniques into two groups: 

\paragraph{Statement-Edit mutations}
One family of repair approaches, including GenProg~\cite{legoues12}, 
TrpAutoRepair~\cite{Qi13TrpAutoR}, and AE~\cite{Weimer13},
creates candidate 
patches by applying coarse-grained mutation operators (usually \emph{append}, \emph{delete}, or 
\emph{replace}) at the statement or block level. These prior techniques target the C programming language, where
a statement is a grammar nonterminal corresponding intuitively to blocks,
simple statements that terminate
with a semicolon, or compound statements corresponding to control flow or
loops. In Java, statements conceptually map to similar program elements, including blocks,  while loops, or single-line
method calls. In these approaches, the statements being appended or replaced
typically come from within the project being modified. This is grounded in the
notion that source code has a high level of
redundancy~\cite{Hindle12Naturalness}. 

\paragraph{Template-based mutations}
Another family of approaches instantiates
predetermined templates, more complex than those in the first family of
approaches, at applicable code locations.  This family includes PAR~\cite{kim2013}, 
SPR~\cite{fan15SPR}, and 
Prophet~\cite{long16proph}.

PAR is the product of a study of a large number of 
human 
created patches, from which human annotators abstracted 10 different templates to cover
the most commonly-used changes in bug-fixing practice.
The 10 considered templates are detailed in the top section of Figure~\ref{approachTemplates}. In the interest of completeness, we also include six extra templates 
mentioned on the PAR website.\footnote{\url{https://sites.google.com/site/autofixhkust/home/fix-templates}} 
These extra templates provide new mutation operators drawn from human edits,
that help us compare to and
generalize the other approaches; they are shown in the middle segment of
Figure~\ref{approachTemplates}. 
SPR and Prophet use a set of transformation schemas,
shown in the Bottom section of Figure~\ref{approachTemplates}.

\begin{figure}[ht]

    SPR transformation schemas. We use the templates in the top and middle
    portions of this table as representative of the class of Template-based mutations. \label{approachTemplates}}
}

\end{figure}

The SPR/Prophet transformation schema can be mapped to certain PAR 
templates. For example, \emph{Condition Introduction} can be seen as a superset of 
\emph{Range Checker}, \emph{Collection Size 
Checker}, \emph{Class Cast Checker}, and \emph{Null Checker}. \emph{Condition Refinement} includes \emph{Expression Adder and Remover}. \emph{Insert Initialization} can be 
generalized from \emph{Object Initializer}, \emph{Upper Bound Setter} and \emph{Lower Bound Setter}; \emph{Conditional Control Flow Introduction} can be 
seen as a subset of \emph{Sequence Exchanger};
\emph{Value Replacement} can be seen as a superset of \emph{Method 
Replacer}, \emph{Parameter Replacer}, \emph{Castee Mutator} and \emph{Expression Changer}; and \emph{Copy 
and Replace} can be matched to \emph{Expression Adder}. 
These operators similarly generalize those used in semantics-based approaches,
which replace expressions used either in conditions or on the right-hand-side of
assignments (the operators are the same; the difference lies in how the fix code
is selected/constructed). 

The templates used in the program modification tool Kali~\cite{Qi15}
also correspond to subsets of certain PAR templates or their extensions. 
For example, \emph{Redirect Branch} can be seen as
a subset of \emph{Expression Changer}, and \emph{Insert Return} and \emph{Remove Statement} are
subsets of \emph{Expression Adder and Remover} accordingly. Similarly,
many other operators from the field of mutation testing~\cite{Offutt06}, as used in
APR~\cite{debroy10,xuan16} can be seen as subsets of the extensions of the 
Par templates.  

To summarize, these approaches have significant similarities between their
included templates.  We use the PAR templates to represent this category
for the following reasons: (1) PAR includes the other techniques' mutation operators, (2) it
provides a concrete description of how the code is changed, enabling
replication, and (3) it explicitly targets Java (SPR, Prophet and Kali
target C), reducing the extent to which we must apply subjective judgement to
determine how to reimplement and use them in our context.

\section{Program repair via a learned probabilistic edit model} \label{buildingTheModel}

In this section we describe how we mined a probabilistic
model of human bug-fixing edits from a large set of popular Java projects on
GitHub.\todo{to what end/purpose?} The intuition behind this model is to be able to apply human
knowledge\todo{Mau: this sentence stops existing. Can you please expand it to
  give a roadmap for the section as well as a high-level idea of how repair works?}

\subsection{Selecting the corpus}

We cloned the 500 most-starred Java projects on Github 
as of August 2016 and
identified the most recent 100 bug fixing commits per each project. Identifying
such commits is a difficult
problem~\cite{Bird09}. We filter these by applying a
regular expression to each commit message that looks for words such as \emph{``fix", ``bug", ``issue", ``problem",}
etc. following the guidelines of previous work~\cite{schroter06}.
%\cite{schroter06,Cubranic05,Fischer03}. 
%
%\\
%\\
%$[Ff]ix(ed|es|ing)?(\backslash s)*([Bb]ug|[Ii]ssue|[Pp]roblem)?(s)?$
%\\
%\\
We further only include commits
that exclusively 
modify Java source code, since we focus on such bugs. Additionally, we restrict our search to commits 
that modify a maximum of three files. We do this to exclude
big merges, such as pull requests or initial commits, and because
large commits are more likely to include changes unrelated to a bug fix~\cite{Herzig13,Kawrykow11}.
To our knowledge, this is the largest set of bug-fixing commits mined to inform
program repair in the existing literature~\cite{long16proph,Soto16,zhong15,martinez15,xuan16}. 

\subsection{Identifying mutations in developer commits}
\label{sec:mining}

For each considered commit, we refer to the code before the fix as the
\emph{``before-fix"} version and the code after as the \emph{``after-fix"} version.
We seek to identify the changes performed between the before-fix and
after-fix versions, match them to our considered mutation operators
(Section~\ref{categorization}), and count how many times each operator is used
in the edits in our corpus. 
We used Gumtree~\cite{falleri14}, a source code tree
differencing framework to identify deletions and insertions, as augmented by a
component of QACrashFix~\cite{gao15}, which allows it to more accurately account for
replacement edits. 
These tools create an AST representation of each program file, both before- and after-fix, and produce a set of 
changes performed between them. 

The changes output by these tools do not all directly map to the template- and
statement-based operators we consider.  That is, there is no one-to-one
correspondence between the list of changes and the mutation operator
identification. We thus greedily attempt to match the identified changes to the 
studied
mutation operators. We seek each of the mutation operators that can match a given set
of edits.  For example, to identify
a \emph{Null Checker} application, for each action describing a commit, we check
if the manipulated node
is an \emph{IfStatement}.  If so, we check whether the action
is a node insertion.  If so, we check if the condition in the inserted
\emph{IfStatement} is an 
\emph{InfixExpression} that compares an 
%  An \emph{InfixExpression} as defined by the Eclipse JDT API
% specification has the following form: 
% \\
% \\
% $InfixExpression: \\
% Expression~InfixOperator~Expression
% $
% \\
% \\  
\emph{Expression} to a
\emph{NullLiteral}. If so, we count this sequence of
actions as an instance of a \emph{Null Checker} mutation operator.  These rules are
necessarily heuristic, and we do not claim perfect soundness in our matching,
instead aggregating results over a large dataset.  



%\begin{figure}[!]
%\begin{verbatim}
%var res = 0
%for (ac <- actions) {

%  }

\subsection{APR using a two-level probabilistic model}

\begin{figure}[!h]
 \centering
    \includegraphics[width=\columnwidth]{Picture2}
  \caption{Two level probabilistic model to inform operator selection and instantiation. \label{fig:probModel}}
\end{figure}

We propose a novel syntactic generate-and-validate repair
technique that differs
from prior work first, in the range of mutation operators considered
(Section~\ref{categorization}) and second, in how it chooses between those
operators and instantiates them.  
We instantiate this technique by extending an open-source implementation of
GenProg~\cite{legoues12} adapted for Java.  We add the newly-considered mutation
operators, and a mechanism that allows the tool to
select between the mutation operators according to the probabilities described by
a provided model.\footnote{As with other artifacts, we will release a link to
  this implementation post-blind review; the open-source repository in question contains
  significant clues as to author identities.}
Building on an existing heuristic search technique allows us to more precisely
control for the effects of our novelties in our evaluation.  

Our approach uses a two-level model (Figure~\ref{fig:probModel}) in operator
selection/instantiation.  The first level informs the selection of the given
mutation operator, from a set of legal operators at a given potentially-faulty
location (e.g. \emph{Parameter replacer} cannot be applied to a \emph{BreakStatement}).  If the operator selected is \emph{replace}, the second level of the
model informs the seleciton of the replacement code.  These two models are
constructed as follows: 

\subsubsection{Mutation operator probabilistic model}
The \textit{Mutation operator probabilistic model} 
describes the probabilities of choosing between the several different mutation 
operators at a particular fault location.
%
To build the \textit{Mutation operator probabilistic model} 
we count the number of incidences of each mutation operator observed in our
dataset, matched as described in Section~\ref{sec:mining}. Mutation operator probability is then
weighted by its appearance in the dataset.  
%
In our dataset overall, the Template-Based mutations comprise 29.26\% of the corpus; Statement-Edit mutations make up 70.74\% of the 
corpus.

\subsubsection{Replacements probabilistic model}
If the ``Replacement" mutation operator is 
selected, the \textit{Replacements probabilistic model} describes the probability of replacing one statement (``replacee") with
another (``replacer"), thus informing the selection of replacement fix code.
%\footnote{https://goo.gl/mMFbnQ
We consider 
the 22 different types detailed by the Eclipse
JDT\footnote{AssertStatement, Block, BreakStatement, ConstructorInvocation, ContinueStatement, DoStatement, EmptyStatement, EnhancedForStatement, ExpressionStatement, ForStatement, IfStatement, LabeledStatement, ReturnStatement, SuperConstructorInvocation, SwitchCase, SwitchStatement, SynchronizedStatement, ThrowStatement, TryStatement, TypeDeclarationStatement, VariableDeclarationStatement, WhileStatement \label{stmtNames}} as
direct known subclasses of the class \texttt{Statement}, and the incidence with which
each 
replaces another. For example: ``What is the observed incidence of a \texttt{For} loop 
replacing a \texttt{While} loop?" Given 22 statement types, any of which may replace one
another, there are 484 possible combinations. 
Note that the observed probabilities are not reciprocal, e.g. 
that the probability of a \texttt{For} loop replacing a \texttt{While} loop is different from the 
probability of a \texttt{While} loop replacing a \texttt{For} loop.
This model is built analogously to the
mutation operator model, based on replacer/replacee statement incidence. 

\vspace{1ex}
To build both models we perform an incidence count of each mutation operator and replacement observed in our
dataset, matched as described in Section~\ref{sec:mining}, and then apply Laplace smoothing~\cite{Russell10} with $\alpha$ = 1 to account for 0 occurrences.

\subsection{Multiple edit association rule mining} 
\label{multEdit}

Although single-edit patches can
repair non-trivial bugs in real software, the majority of bug fixes in real
software require multiple edits~\cite{zhong15,Soto16}. The combination of possible mutation
 operators to apply in a sequence increases exponentially as we add more source
 code changes, motivating a more precise mechanism to navigate the vast search
 space. 

As a first step towards mitigating this limitation, we propose 
an initial analysis of multi-edit 
source code changes by mining a more expressive model of common changes. In
particular, we extract \emph{association rules} between single edits 
to model chains of single edit changes, capturing the way humans create these kinds of fixes.

Association rules are if/then statements that show relationships between elements in a dataset which happen frequently together. We use the 
well-known association rule mining algorithm
Apriori~\cite{Agrawal94}. 
%
Two basic concepts critical to this method are \emph{Confidence} and \emph{Support}.
Formally, we define Confidence as:

\begin{center}
$conf(X \implies Y) = \dfrac{supp(X \cup Y)}{supp(X)}$ 
\end{center}

Where X and Y are possible items in a transaction (mutation operators or replacements, in our
context). Confidence is calculated according to its Support (\emph{supp}), 
an indication of how frequently the set of mutation operators or replacements (itemset) 
 occurs in the transaction base.
Formally:

\begin{center}
$supp(X) = \dfrac{|\{t \in T; X \subseteq t\}|}{|T|}$
\end{center}

Where X is the itemset and \emph{t} is each individual transaction in
the database of transactions \emph{T}. Apriori identifies the mutation
operators and replacements that frequently happen together, iteratively extending them to larger
itemsets that appear often in the transactions as identified by these metrics.

We mine association rules from each of the models described in Section~\ref{armRes} by transforming each of the mutation operator count and replacement count from 
each of the commits studied into a \emph{transaction} to be analyzed. 
We look for rules that have at least 90\% Confidence.


\section{Evaluation} \label{evaluation}

We evaluate our model both independently and as part of an automatic repair
technique.  We have four high-level research questions:

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{RQ1:} How accurate are our mined models in predicting mutation
  operators and replacement code across a large dataset?
(Section~\ref{sec:generalize})
\item \textbf{RQ2:} Which syntactic operators and selection models are most
  useful for repair? (Section~\ref{sec:oputil})
\item \textbf{RQ3:} How does our model-informed APR tool compare to the
    state-of-the-art in APR? (Section~\ref{sec:comparison})
\item \textbf{RQ4:} What are the most common multi-edit modification rules in
    practice? (Section~\ref{armRes})
\end{itemize}


All experiments are performed on a server 
consisting of 16 processors Intel(R) Xeon(R) CPU E5-2699 v3, with 2.30 GHz each
processor, 46080 KB cache each, and 32 GB RAM memory, operating system Ubuntu 
14.04.5 LTS.  In addition to addressing our research questions as described in
the above roadmap, we provide additional detail on the experimental setup for
all repair experiments in Section~\ref{sec:repairSetup}.

}}
\end{figure} 


We begin by independently evaluating our models' predictive accuracy, to
validate the underlying intuition.  We include all Statement-level and Templated
mutations (taken from Par), as described in Section~\ref{categorization}.

\subsubsection{Setup}
Our high-level research question concerns whether 
our mined models are likely to identify the correct fix code across a large
dataset, suggesting their potential utility in a repair context.  We therefore
compare the accuracy of the models to an \emph{equally distributed} baseline,
which selects a mutation (or replacement) uniformly at random. 
We measure how often each model correctly predicts the mutation operator (or
replacer statement, for a given replacee statement), within the top 5 produced
choices. Perfect accuracy (correctness in the Top-1 most likely choice) is
unnecessary, since our APR approach can iterate through several
different candidates before a fix; 
however, the noisy search problem suggests that a relatively tight bound (top-5)
is likely appropriate (and, observationally, is the point of inflection between
mined and equally-distributed model performance.)

To illustrate, consider a simple example. Assume the following
simple bug-fixing patch from our corpus: 

\begin{lstlisting}[frame=single]
+ if(i > l.size()) {
    return l.get(i); @//original faulty location@
+  }    
\end{lstlisting}

The developer has replaced the original \texttt{return} with an
\texttt{if-then} statement that wraps it.  In assessing the replacement model,
we ask, assuming the selected mutation operator 
is \emph{replace}, how often will an \emph{IfStatement} be predicted as the
replacer for a \emph{ReturnStatement}? If it is returned in the first five
instances in a model, the model correctly predicts this instance.  For the
equally distributed model, we select five operators/replacees at random. 

We use 10-fold cross validation~\cite{kohavi95} to mitigate the risk
of overfitting and avoid testing and training on the same data.  We segregated
the projects in our corpus into 10 random folds. For each fold, we use one fold
for testing, and the remaining nine for training. We aggregate the results over
all 10 folds counting the number of testing instances that are correctly
predicted by the first five guesses from the training sub-model.

\subsubsection{Results} 

Figure~\ref{results10fcv} shows results. For each fold, we show the instance
count and percentage of correctly predicted instances within the top five
guesses of both the equally distributed and the probablistic models for both the
Replacements (middle) and Mutations (right) models. The \# columns 
show the number of attempted instances per fold.  The ``Prob.'' columns show the
accuracy (correct prediction rate) of the mined model on that fold, for each model; ``EqDist'',
the accuracy of the equally distributed model.  For the Replacements model,
the average accuracy of the Probabilistic model is 63\% higher than the EqDist
model; the difference is 56.4\% for the Mutations model.

When we applied a Two sample t-test for means to the different sets of results when predicting replacements, we obtain a p-value of 0.00000003 which is far below our alpha level of 5\% which means there is a very marked statistical significance between the two populations. When applying the same test predicting mutation operators, we obtain a p-value of 0.00012 which is still far below 5\% meaning that there is a strong statistical significance.

This indicates that the probabilistic approach is
significantly more accurate than an equally-distributed baseline (used in
several syntactic APR approaches) in predicting bug-fixing edits.  This suggests
that the model, incorporated into an APR approach, may be more likely to produce
correct patches.  We directly address this question next.

\end{figure} 


We have two high-level research concerns related to the utility of our
learned models for repair: 
(1) Which syntactic operators and selection models are most
  useful for repair? (Section~\ref{sec:oputil}) and (2)
How does our model-informed APR tool compare to the
    state-of-the-art in APR? (Section~\ref{sec:comparison})

\paragraph{Validation of models in context} We first we evaluate the utility of our models in the
context of several different set of mutation operators.  We do this to
independently validate that the models are useful in context (rather than simply
as predictors, as established in the previous subsections), and second to
identify which sets of syntactic mutation operators appear most useful in
practice.  To do this, we
instantiate our tool with each of 
two models (the Equally Distributed baseline from Section~\ref{sec:generalize}
and the learned Probabilistic models), and three different operator sets (1) Statement-Edit mutations only (2)
Template-based mutations only, and (3) All mutations. We evaluate each version
for expressive power (in terms of bugs fixed), variants to repair (a machine-
and test suite-independent proxy for time), and quality of the produced patches
(evaluated as described below). 

To diminish the degree of randomness in this experiment and control for the
effect of the mutation probabilities specifically rather than inefficiency and
noise in fault localization, we manually set the fault localization for each
bug. Anecdotally, we observe that less-accurate fault localization increases the
amount of time our tool needs to repair these defects, but does not decrease expressive
power.  

\paragraph{Comparison to previous techniques} Second, we compare our tool, using
the best set of operators as identified in the first question, to four
previously-prosed APR tools: GenProg, TrpAutoRepair, PAR and Nopol.\todo{add a
  reference for each of these.} These prior approaches provide coverage over
several dimensions that differentiate program repair techniques.  GenProg and
TrpAutoRepair use the same statement-level edits, but differ in their search
strategies (GenProg uses a genetic programming strategy; TrpAutoRepair, also
known as RSRepair, a random walk). PAR uses GenProg's genetic programming search
strategy, but a different set of templated mutation operators.  Nopol is a
semantics-guided generate-and-validate repair approach that thus uses a fix code
identification strategy that is quite different from the operators we
consider.\footnote{Note that, in this study we do not compare directly to
  SPR/Prophet~\cite{long16proph}, because they use machine learning to tune the
  probabilities to rank their schemas instantiation and are thus much more
  difficult to reimplement faithfully; additionally, as established, their
  schemas are generalized by the extended PAR templates we consider, which are
  already tailored to Java, reducing the potentially subjective judgement required to
  translate and reimplement them.}

The open-source implementation of GenProg for Java that we use implements 
the behavior and mutation operators of the first three approaches, translated
from their C versions (for GenProg and TRPAutoRepair) or online documentation
and publication (for PAR, for which there is no publicly-available original implementation).  We use patch results released
by the Nopol authors on this same dataset, and do not rerun their experiments.
The Nopol authors have created patches for the same benchmark used in
this study~\cite{martinez2016} and made their results publicly
available.\footnote{\url{https://github.com/Spirals-Team/defects4j-repair/tree/master/results/2017-march}}
There are several sets of available results available on the Nopol GitHub page.
Although we would prefer to compare to the published results, 
the most ``March 2017'' version contains results for more of the defects we
consider in our subset (by contrast, if we use the 2015 results, there is only
one patch repaired in common between our technique and Nopol, reducing the
interest of the comparison).  We thus use the most recent dataset in our comparison.
\todo{pending to add more justification depending on Martin's response} 

For the comparitive experiments, we look at expressive power (bugs repaired) and
patch quality.  We do not compare time to repair, which is influenced by fault
localization (which is not held constant between the techniques) and thus would
be less informative, and because we do not have the requisite data for
Nopol.\todo{That's true, right?}

\paragraph{Dataset}
We consider for repair a subset of the Defects4j~\cite{just14}
benchmark, a database and extensible 
framework of real bugs that enables reproducible studies in software testing and
has been preivously used to evaluate APR~\cite{Durieux15}. 
It currently contains 395 real bugs from 6
open source programs, along with developer-provided test suites, cases that
expose each bug,  and
corresponding developer-provided patches.  Figure~\ref{defects4j} characterizes
the dataset.\footnote{Note that we initiated this study before Defects4J added
  the Mockito project.} Because we compare to single-edit techniques, we
restrict attention to a subset of the Defects4J bugs with single-line human
patches. \todo{Mau, I may have cut this accidentally in my reorg, but add how
  many bugs we consider from each.}

\paragraph{Patch quality}
As a proxy for patch quality (to mitigate the risk of plausible but as yet
incorrect patches~\cite{Qi15}), we evaluate patches using a held-out test
suite~\cite{legoues12Genprog,smith15} by automatically building a second test
suite that independently describes the same behavior as the test suite that
guides the search process. We generate a single held out suite for each buggy program version that any technique
repairs.  We use Randoop~\cite{pacheco07}, an established automatic
test suite generation tool for Java, to generate this second test suite. We run
Randoop with a ten minute budget (six times the default value) to create the
held-out test suites. We calculate line 
coverage of the generated test suite over the class that contains the human fix.\todo{Mau:
  pre-fix or after-fix?}

\paragraph{Settings} For the genetic programming based techniques (including our own), our population
size is 40 (consistent with previous work), and our max generation size is 10.
For non-GP-based techniques, our maximum considered variant count is 400; for
all techniques, we set a timeout of 4 hours per run.  These settings are
conssitent with prior work.  We run 20 seeds per randomized repair trial, in
keeping with recommendations on the assessment of stochastic
techniques~\cite{arcuri11}.

\end{figure*}

\todo{re visit this paragraph after we have the latest results}Our modified APR
techniques, using each of three sets of operators and each of two models to
select between them, patched 5 of the 18 bugs, as shown in 
Figure~\ref{tab:singleLineBugs}.
The first row of Figure~\ref{tab:singleLineBugs} (Closure \#10) shows that the
probabilistic model outperforms the equally-distributed model for all three
statement sets.  This happens as well for
Math \#2 and Time \#19, except for the cases where no patch was
found. By contrast, for bugs Chart \#1 and Closure \#18, the equally
distributed approach finds a patch faster on average. Investigating this case
manually, we find that 
these bugs are patched with mutations that are rarely to applied by developers (Expression Replace, and Replacement accordingly),
therefore it is more likely that the mutation operator will be chosen by a
uniformly random selection than by the developer-informed model.

Our results suggest that considering all available mutation operators is
preferable to 
restricting the mutation operator pool to just one of the categories \todo{revisit this after we have more results}. For the
Statement-Edit category, 3 out of 6 were fixed faster when combining it with
Template-Based mutations, and 3 out of 6 were slower. For the Template-Based
category: 4 out of 8 were fixed faster when combining it with Statemtent-Edit
mutations, 2 out of 8 were the same, and 2 out of 8 were slower. This suggests
that the expressive power afforded by an increased set of operators may
outweight the commensurate increase in search space size, though it is safe to
assume that this benefit must be supported by sufficiently accurate fault
localization. 

 %\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mausotog/ReplacementsEmpiricalStudy/tree/master/Randoop10MinHeldOutTestSuites}} 
We noticed a
constant behavior regarding the different sets of mutations. In this sample, if
a model is able to find a patch faster, this appears independent of the mutation
set.  We also notice that
the quality of patches produced  appears constant, and unaffected by model:
either the tool produces patches in 
that all pass the second test suite, or it produces patches that do not. 

\todo{Mau: Discussion/interpretation of patch quality results}

From these results, we conclude that the probabilistic model using all available
mutation operators (both Statement- and Template-based) appears to maximize
expressive power without an unacceptable loss to efficiency.  In conjunction
with our model assessment results (Section~\ref{sec:generalize}), we thus
incorporate these features in our technique for our next experiment, which
compares our new technique to the previous state-of-the-art.

% One indicative example that illustrates the utility of the probablistic model

% (Figure~\ref{fig:chart1.1}, top).  The developer patches this bug by deleting the if
% statement.  The mined statement-level mutation model favors deletion, and thus
% our repair efforts found patches that removed either the entire \texttt{IfStatement}, or only its body (line 9).
% By contrast, the equally-distributed model has a higher probability of leading
% to a patch such as the one shown in the bottom of Figure~\ref{fig:chart1.1}.  This test case
% passes when, in the case that \texttt{dataset} is not null, nothing is returned;
% this patch avoids this, but also allocates state variables that are not

Figure~\ref{stateOfTheArtComparison} compares patching results for our
probablistic model-based repair to GenProg, TrpAutoRepair, PAR, and Nopol.
Unlike in Figure~\ref{tab:singleLineBugs}, we break out these results by unique
patches found over multiple repair trials per technique (for those that use
randomness, that is, every technique but Nopol).  We show 
the number of held-out tests each patch fails; lower is better (again by
contrast with Figure~\ref{tab:singleLineBugs}, where higher was better in the
quality columns). Of the \todo{how many?}
patches created by our approach, 
five pass all held-out test suite (45.5\%). None of the GenProg,
TRPAutoRepair, or PAR patches fully generalize; 25\% of Nopol's patches do.
This gives us confidence that our approach produces high
quality patches in comparison with the alternatives created by state-of-the-art
tools. 

One example demonstrating the quality improvement afforded by the probabilistic
model-based approach is evident for the Clousre 18 bug.  in which we can very clearly see the success of our approach when
applying the probabilistic model is Closure 18 as seen in
Figure~\ref{closure18prob} where, not only did our approach created the exact
same patch as the human did, but also our approach was able to find the patch
within the time frame specified before the execution is shutdown by one of the
constraints per execution while other approaches that are able to create this
patch, couldn't because they ran out of time.

This example was fixed by the human by removing an expression from an
\emph{IfStatement} as seen at the top of Figure~\ref{closure18prob}. 
Although PAR includes this a mutation operator for this task, its uniform
weighting scheme appears less efficient than our probabilistic model. Nopol was
able to create a patch for this example as shown at the bottom of 
Figure~\ref{closure18prob}, but this patch is not able to generalize to a
held-out test suite.

\subsection{Association Rule Mining} \label{armRes}

We mined our corpus using the Association Rule Mining algorithm Apriori 
to find rules of mutation operators and 
replacements that commonly happen together providing an intuition regarding
how to form multi-edit
source code changes.

\paragraph{Mutation operator rules}
We mine rules from our corpus as described in Section~\ref{multEdit}.  
These rules are ranked by their confidence. In this case, the top 10 \todo{we can shorten this to 5 rules if we need space} rules shown
below have a confidence of 100\%, meaning that in 100\% of the cases
studied, every transaction that showed the antecedent also showed the consequent.
They are obtained with a 1\% support, which means that each of these rules
individually appear in at least 1\% of all the transactions in the
corpus. We show the top association rules for the mining of single edit 
mutation operators to indicate the structure of the rules; and release the full set of mined
rules with over 90\% Confidence and 0.1\% Support:\footnote{We will release the full list of mutation operator and replacements rules post blind-review.} %\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mausotog/ReplacementsEmpiricalStudy/blob/master/ResultsAssociationRuleMiningMutOperators.txt}} 

%Minimum support: 0 (1 instances)
%Minimum metric <confidence>: 0.9
%Number of cycles performed: 20

\begin{itemize}
\item Replace \& Delete $\implies$ Append
\item Delete \& AddNullCheck $\implies$ Append
\item Replace \& SeqExchanger $\implies$ Append
\item Replace \& ParamReplacer $\implies$ Append
\item Delete \& CasteeMutator $\implies$ Append
\item Replace \& Delete \& ParamReplacer $\implies$ Append
\item Replace \& AddNullCheck $\implies$ Append
\item Replace \& Delete \& SeqExchanger $\implies$ Append
\item Delete \& ExpressionAdder $\implies$ Append
\item Delete \& AddNullCheck \& ParamReplacer $\implies$ Append
\end{itemize}

Append is the most common single edit mutation operator applied by developers. This behavior is
reflected in the fact that it is the consequent in the all the top mined
rules.  

\paragraph {Replacement rules} We also analyzed association rules for the
replacements model, obtaining
the following rules with a 0.01\% Support and 90\% Confidence. %\footnote{\url{https://github.com/mausotog/ReplacementsEmpiricalStudy/blob/master/ResultsAssociationRuleMiningReplacements.txt}} 
The best rules we found are: \todo{we can shorten this to 5 if necessary}
%Minimum support: 0.0001 (1 instances)
%Minimum metric <confidence>: 0.9
%Number of cycles performed: 20
\begin{itemize}
\item Block replaces ReturnStatement \& ExpressionStatement replaces IfStatement $\implies$ Block replaces IfStatement
\item VariableDeclarationStatement replaces AssertStatement $\implies$ SwitchCase replaces BreakStatement
\item EnhancedForStatement replaces TryStatement $\implies$ ExpressionStatement replaces ReturnStatement
\item ForStatement replaces TryStatement $\implies$ ExpressionStatement replaces VariableDeclarationStatement
\item VariableDeclarationStatement replaces EnhancedForStatement $\implies$ ExpressionStatement replaces VariableDeclarationStatement
\item VariableDeclarationStatement replaces ForStatement $\implies$ ExpressionStatement replaces VariableDeclarationStatement
\item ForStatement replaces TryStatement $\implies$ IfStatement replaces TryStatement
\item VariableDeclarationStatement replaces ForStatement $\implies$ ForStatement replaces TryStatement
\item ForStatement replaces TryStatement $\implies$ VariableDeclarationStatement replaces ForStatement
\item VariableDeclarationStatement replaces ForStatement $\implies$ IfStatement replaces TryStatement
\end{itemize}

%Similar to the one described above, the authors have made available the full list of association rules with over 90\% Confidence and 0.01\% Support.\footnote{https://goo.gl/omk60t}
%REPLACE FOR CAMERA READY: https://github.com/mausotog/ReplacementsEmpiricalStudy/blob/master/ResultsAssociationRuleMiningReplacements.txt

Association rules provide an intuition of which common patterns of behavior developers use. These rules tell us what edits happen frequently together, which will help us further understand multi-edit source code changes, an understudied area that covers the majority of real life patches.

\section{Threats to Validity} \label{threatsVal}

\noindent\textbf{Internal validity:}
Regarding possible errors in our implementation and experiments, to run our
comparison with Genprog, we used an open-source implementation of GenProg
targeting Java. We release our code, as well as our templates,
independently-generated tests, and mined models for scrutiny and extension by other
researchers, to mitigate the risk of errors in our implementation or approach. 
 We also use 10-fold cross validation in
assessing our model, to reduce the risk of training and testing on the same
data.  
%REMOVE THIS FOR CAMERA READY
%in the project mentioned before 

\noindent\textbf{External validity:} 
It is possible 
that our results will not generalize to external datasets and to
real bugs. To mitigate this concern, we build our model from well-known open-source
programs, covering a diversity of applications, and distinct from the dataset
from which the models were mined, and we evaluate our approach with bugs from an open-source framework.

There is also risk of producing low quality patches that would not 
generalize
to a different description of desired program behavior. We attenuate 
this by 
assessing the quality of the generated patches with a held-out test suite.
There is risk in the fact that we are manually giving the
faulty location to the APR tool, since APR tools do not know in advance what the 
fault location is. This is for the purposes of evaluating the patch creating 
process
only without the noise that fault localization might introduce.

\noindent\textbf{Construct validity:}
Regarding the suitability of our evaluation metrics, we evaluate patch
quality by running the generated patches on a second test suite created
from a human patch, which is to a certain extent a biased measure since we can
not guarantee that the human created patch is perfect~\cite{smith15}. Nevertheless, we consider 
this to be a
best known practice, since this way we provide an alternative to subjectively 
asking a biased human developer
whether he/she considered the patch to be correct or not. 

We also rely on Randoop~\cite{pacheco07} as our test suite generation mechanism 
for the held-out test suite used for evaluation, and we acknowledge that the 
test suites created by this tool may not be perfect, nor provide full coverage. 
Nonetheless, this is a state of the art test suite generation tool that mitigates the risk of bias in manually constructing evaluation test suites.

\section{Related Work} \label{relatedWork}

There have been previous efforts to create a model based on human behavior.  
Soto et al.~\cite{Soto16} 
built a probabilistic model to describe the replace 
operator only. They do not evaluate the model in the context of a repair
tool, and the model is based on an instance count of statements rather than an a more 
accurate analysis of AST differences, which our model was built from.  
Our two-level probabilistic model thus generalizes this previous work~\cite{Soto16}:
HDRepair~\cite{xuan16} 
uses fix history
to help assess patch suitability and fitness in the context of a genetic
programming search strategy. The fitness of the generated
fix candidates is determined by the frequency with which the changes included in
a given patch occur in the corpus, using a Graph-based representation of the bug
fixes.  Similarly, Prophet~\cite{long16proph} uses a
probabilistic model of a subset of our considered mutation operators built on 
the history of 8 different projects to rank candidate
patches.  Our approach follows this intuition to mimic human
behavior; unlike the previous work, we apply this knowledge when actually
creating patch candidates rather than when evaluating them, which reduces the 
search space at the time of creation.  

Zhong and Su~\cite{zhong15} perform an empirical study of
real bug fixes on six projects, studying the incidence of three mutation
operators, among other questions about the applicability of APR.  Martinez and
Monperrus~\cite{martinez15} similarly study mutation operator incidence across 
14 
projects. Our work considers a broader set of
mutation operators over a larger corpus, the largest, to the best of our
knowledge, studied in existing work. To counter the 
risk of overfitting to a small set of training projects as performed before, our 
current study trains the model over 500 projects, covering a diversity 
of domains.

Par~\cite{kim2013} describes a manual set of 10 templates of common behavior to
create patches, showing that such templates result in patches of higher
human-adjuded acceptability than statement-edit-based patches.  Our study takes 
into consideration a superset
of these templates, provides steps towards
accounting for multi-edit source code changes, an understudied problem, and,
importantly, mines and models these operators and their incidence automatically
(rather than manually).

There exist a broad array of APR techniques proposed, especially recently; we
survey many of them in Section~\ref{background}, focusing on heuristic or
syntactic generate-and-validate techniques.  Semantic-based techniques use
semantic analysis or reasoning~\cite{nguyen13,mechtaev15,Mechtaev2016}, or
semantic search~\cite{ke15} to construct candidate patches.  Similarly,
synthesis-based repair is a family of techniques that uses constraints to build
patches following the description of the constraints~\cite{jin11,wei10}. These constraints may be
specifications created by developers, formal verification, invariants,
etc.~\cite{jin11,wei10}.  Such techniques typically use synthesis to construct
repairs, with a different mechanism for both constructing and traversing the
search space, and our approach is thus less immediately comparable.
 

\section{Conclusion} \label{conclusion}

In this paper, we analyze the way in which current state of the art automatic 
program repair approaches select mutation operators to create candidate 
patches. We analyze, categorize and compare the mutation operators being used by 
state of the art approaches. We analyzed the last 100 bug fixing commits from 
the
500 most-starred Java projects on Github, which is the largest corpus analyzed
to date, to the best of our knowledge.  We created a two-level probabilistic 
model describing
the likelihood of selecting bug-fixing mutation operators, according to the
observed incidence of their use by human developers. All the data gathered, 
tools and test suites used in this study are publicly available for open peer review 
and scrutiny.

We evaluated our single-edit approach in several ways: by performing an internal 
evaluation of 
its predictive power (using 10 fold cross 
validation), by comparing the speed of the model by comparing it to an equally 
distributed model and  
 running them on 15 bugs using the database of bugs and extensible 
framework Defects4j, and finally by comparing the quality of the patches 
generated against patches created for these same bugs by other state of the art 
approaches. 

For these bugs, we measured the number of variants it takes to find the 
patch as well as the quality of produced patches, using a second 
automatically-created held-out test suite.
Note that in Figure~\ref{tab:singleLineBugs}, for the majority of bugs, the 
equally distributed model performed better than their equally distributed 
counterpart.
We also notice that applying different probabilities when constructing variants
does not make the patches found in either of the models more likely to pass a
second test suite for these five bugs. Further evaluation should be performed to
determine if one of the models creates higher quality patches than the other. 
Overall, however, we found that automatic program repair appears to benefit
from having a diverse mutation operator pool containing mutation operators from 
both categories,
rather than restricting their choices to just one category, increase in search
space size notwithstanding; future improvements in fault localization thus will
serve to further benefit from more precise models of mutation selection. 

Multi-edit source code changes are understudied, but cover
the vast majority of bug fixes in software systems. 
To move towards advancing this area, we constructed a set of association rules 
that describe 
how often different sets of mutation operators can predict the change that will 
come next, and how often subsets of mutation operators are applied together.

There is a tension between the Support and the Confidence measures in our 
transaction 
base, in which we 
evaluate the different mutation operators being applied to source code in bug 
fixing commits. 
If we increase the Confidence and decrease Support, we obtain rules such that
the antecedents and consequents have a higher rate of occurring together. By 
lowering Support this will produce rules that
do not occur often.  Although, when they \emph{are} selected, are very likely to 
be
correct. 

On the other hand, if 
we increase the Support and decrease the Confidence we would obtain rules that 
are guaranteed to happen in a certain percent of the corpus, which means,
the relationship described by the rules, happens often, but confidence is 
sacrificed, which means that there will be a higher percentage of the 
transactions in which the antecedent is present, but the consequent is not. 
Overall, this initial analysis of how single-edit source code changes can be 
chained together 
to become multi-edit source code changes by following human behavior provides a
first step towards an efficient mechanism for traversing the large search space
of multi-edit repairs.
